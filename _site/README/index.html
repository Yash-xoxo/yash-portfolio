<h1>My portfolio, created for <a href="http://andrewborstein.com">andrewborstein.com</a></h1>
<p>Tools used to build this website (first created in 2015, with only minor content updates since):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> - you can host any static website (HTML, CSS, JS) really easily using GitHub, totally for free!</li>
<li><a href="https://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> - a super handy CSS framework to get Google's Material Design components and style</li>
<li>And a bunch of custom CSS to get it looking just right.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
<li>I recently removed Grunt as a build tool dependency and moved my site hosting to Netlify. All files are completely static (for the time being), but they also live in a <code>/public</code> folder instead of the root. If you don't use Netlify, feel free to move everything back into the  root folder instead.</li>
<li>Make sure to set <code>analyticsId</code> to your unique GA account id inside the <code>Google Analytics</code> script tag at the bottom of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.</li>
</ul>
